# 📊 UCI Students Performance Analysis 

This Jupyter Notebook (`student_performance.ipynb`) focuses on the preprocessing steps for a student performance dataset. The goal of this project is to prepare the data for potential machine learning models that predict student grades (G1, G2, G3).

---
## 🫡 Dataset Courtesy 
The notebook utilizes a dataset named `student-mat.csv` from the `student.zip` archive of [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance). This dataset contains various student attributes, their grades in two periods (G1, G2) and final grade (G3).
